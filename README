A simple rigid body physics simulation demo utilizing different methods of numerical integration to calculate the body's position.

1) right-click to add a new body to the simulation
2) left-click and drag to move the body

TODO:

1) add a control panel to switch the integration method during runtime
2) add a control panel to change the colors during runtime
3) add a control panel to change the type of body added
4) add additional forces
5) add a control panel to adjust the gravity level during runtime
